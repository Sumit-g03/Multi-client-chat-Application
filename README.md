**Multi-Client Chat Application**

This repository contains a simple multi-client chat application built in Java. The application consists of three main components:

Server: Handles incoming client connections, manages client sessions, and broadcasts messages to all connected clients.

ClientHandler: Manages individual client connections, handles message sending and receiving, and maintains a list of connected clients.

Client: Represents the client-side application that connects to the server, sends messages, and listens for incoming messages.

**Project Structure**

Server.java: Implements the chat server that listens for incoming client connections on a specified port.

ClientHandler.java: Handles communication between the server and individual clients, including broadcasting messages and managing client sessions.

Client.java: Provides the client-side functionality to connect to the server, send messages, and receive messages from other clients.
